# EEG-based Decoding of Selective Visual Attention in Superimposed Videos

This repository contains the Python code associated with the paper "EEG-based Decoding of Selective Visual Attention in Superimposed Videos" [1].

To reproduce the results, download the features and preprocessed data from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1snerQuJ60Iysy1xwNAxV7dHAmBu-kpmT/view?usp=sharing), and run the Jupyter notebook main.ipynb. (Make sure to update the paths to the data and features in the notebook if needed.) The algorithms used in the analysis are implemented in algo.py.

The dataset used in this research is publicly available at: https://zenodo.org/records/15665101
